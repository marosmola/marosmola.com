Look no further than the AMD Ryzen 5 7500F and the Core i5 13400F. These high-performance processors can provide the speed and power you need to run the latest games and applications. But which one is the better choice for gaming? In this article, we’ll take a closer look at both CPUs to see how they stack up against each other.","Marek Smolen","09-09-2023","Extra text here!","/img/cpu_battle.png",true,{"type":16,"children":17},"root",[18],{"type":19,"tag":20,"props":21,"children":22},"element","p",{},[23],{"type":24,"value":25},"text","First off, let’s talk about the specs. The Ryzen 5 7500F has a base clock speed of 3.8GHz and a boost clock speed of 4.1GHz, with 6 cores and 12 threads. On the other hand, the Core i5 13400F has a base clock speed of 2.6GHz and a boost clock speed of 4.0GHz, with 6 cores and 12 threads. While the Ryzen 5 7500F has a slightly higher clock speed, the Core i5 13400F has a more advanced architecture.",{"type":16,"children":27,"toc":71},[28,32,37,46,51,56,61],{"type":19,"tag":20,"props":29,"children":30},{},[31],{"type":24,"value":25},{"type":19,"tag":20,"props":33,"children":34},{},[35],{"type":24,"value":36},"When it comes to performance, both the Ryzen 5 7500F and Core i5 13400F are powerful processors that can handle most games without breaking a sweat. However, the Core i5 13400F does have the edge in gaming benchmarks, with higher FPS rates in most games. This is largely due to the fact that Intel processors have better single-core performance, which is what most games rely on.",{"type":19,"tag":38,"props":39,"children":40},"blockquote",{},[41],{"type":19,"tag":20,"props":42,"children":43},{},[44],{"type":24,"value":45},"That being said, the Ryzen 5 7500F is still a great choice for gaming. It has better multi-core performance than the Core i5 13400F, which can be beneficial if you’re running other applications while gaming or if you’re doing any kind of multi-tasking. Plus, the Ryzen 5 7500F is generally more affordable than the Core i5 13400F, making it a better choice for budget-conscious gamers.",{"type":19,"tag":20,"props":47,"children":48},{},[49],{"type":24,"value":50},"When it comes to overclocking, both processors are fairly similar. The Ryzen 5 7500F has more overclocking potential, but the Core i5 13400F is easier to overclock due to its simplified BIOS settings. Overclocking can give you a significant boost in performance, but it’s also important to note that it could potentially void your warranty.",{"type":19,"tag":20,"props":52,"children":53},{},[54],{"type":24,"value":55},"In terms of power consumption, the Ryzen 5 7500F has a higher TDP (thermal design power) of 65W compared to the Core i5 13400F’s 65W, which means it may require more power to run and could produce more heat. However, both processors have very similar power consumption and heat output, so this shouldn’t be a major factor in your decision.",{"type":19,"tag":20,"props":57,"children":58},{},[59],{"type":24,"value":60},"Conclusion\nSo, which one is the better choice for gaming? It really depends on your specific needs and budget. If you’re primarily using your PC for gaming and want the best possible FPS rates, the Core i5 13400F is the way to go. However, if you’re on a tight budget or if you plan on doing any kind of multi-tasking or video editing, the Ryzen 5 7500F is still a great choice. No matter which one you choose, both the AMD Ryzen 5 7500F and Core i5 13400F are great processors that can give you the speed and power you need for an enjoyable gaming experience.",{"type":19,"tag":20,"props":62,"children":63},{},[64],{"type":19,"tag":65,"props":66,"children":68},"a",{"href":67},"/",[69],{"type":24,"value":70},"Back home",{"title":7,"searchDepth":72,"depth":72,"links":73},2,[],"markdown","content:blog:graphics:2.about2.md","content","blog/graphics/2.about2.md","md",1700859080825]
